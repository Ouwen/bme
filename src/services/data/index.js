    snippet: <p>
      Machine learning has appreciated a wide range of applications. Industry has developed many software tools and best practices to make data science reproducible, scalable to large datasets, and easy to productionize. The course will focus on applying various deep learning architectures using Tensorflow to solve problems in healthcare, and how to bring these models into production environments. Students will learn the pipeline of: data acquisition, data wrangling, modeling, performance assessment, and deployment.

      <br/><br/>
      
      The class is largely project focused and will lightly touch on concepts in deep learning theory, software engineering, devops, databases, and networking.
